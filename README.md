### **Game Concept: “The Last Train”**

---

#### **Story Idea**

You wake up on the last subway train of the night.
The lights flicker, the sound fades — and suddenly, the train restarts at the same station. Again. And again.

Each loop feels different:

* Passengers act as if they remember the protagonist — or don’t.
* Objects appear and vanish between loops.
* A distant voice on the radio whispers things you’re not sure you want to hear.

As you explore and talk to others, fragments of a personal tragedy start to surface. The loop isn’t just a time glitch — it’s a reflection of your own inability to move on.
The only way out is to face what really happened… and accept it.

**Key Characters:**

* **The Conductor:** Calm, insistent that “the train must keep moving.” Represents denial.
* **The Lost Child:** Searching for their toy — a symbol of innocence and second chances.
* **The Stranger:** Claims to remember dying on this train. Reflects fear and regret.
* **The Radio Voice:** Half memory, half conscience — it tells the truth when you’re ready to hear it.

**Possible Endings:**

* Escape by accepting your past.
* Stay behind to help someone else break free.
* Destroy everything in anger and denial.
* Remain trapped forever, still refusing the truth.

#### **Player Goal & Choices**

The player's goal is to **understand why the loop exists** and decide **how to end it** — or whether to end it at all.

He can achieve this through:

* **Dialogue choices** with passengers that change how they see you — and how you see yourself.
* **Object interactions** that reveal or hide memories (a radio message, a child’s toy, a broken control panel).
* **Decisions** that quietly set boolean variables reflecting your journey:

  | Boolean             | What it represents           | Example effect                         |
  | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
  | `helped_child`      | Compassion and empathy       | Unlocks new emotional dialogue options |
  | `trusted_conductor` | Desire for order and control | Access to the control room             |
  | `listened_radio`    | Openness to truth            | Reveals hidden memories                |
  | `sabotaged_panel`   | Anger and denial             | Leads to destructive ending            |
  | `accepted_past`     | Emotional closure            | Enables true escape                    |

Your emotional state becomes the system logic — the story reacts to what kind of person you’re becoming inside the loop.

#### **Intended Player Experience**

I want players to feel:

* **Curious** — trying to uncover what’s real and what’s imagined.
* **Emotionally engaged** — caring about the passengers and their stories.
* **Reflective** — recognizing parts of themselves in the character’s choices.

Each loop feels like a second chance to do better — not only to escape the train, but to forgive yourself.

The repetition becomes meaningful:
as you repeat actions, you don’t just unlock new paths,
you **understand yourself a little more**.
“The Last Train” isn’t about running away — it’s about finally letting go.
